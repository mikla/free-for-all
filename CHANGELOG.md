# Changelog

## [Latest] - Street-Only Movement System! üõ£Ô∏è

### Added
- **Street-Only Movement**: Players can now only walk on streets, not through buildings or water!
  - **Google Maps Integration**: Uses Google Maps Directions API to validate street positions
  - **Real-time Validation**: Every movement is checked against actual street data
  - **Smart Snapping**: Player positions automatically snap to nearest street point
  - **Visual Feedback**: Clear notification when movement is blocked by buildings/water

### Technical Implementation
- **Street Validation**: `isOnStreet()` function checks if coordinates are on valid roads
- **Position Snapping**: `snapToStreet()` ensures players stay on street network
- **Movement Validation**: `validateMovement()` combines validation and snapping
- **Enhanced UI**: Visual notification system shows when movement is blocked
- **Improved Controls**: Larger movement steps (15m) for better street navigation

### Enhanced Gameplay Experience
- **Realistic Movement**: No more walking through buildings or swimming across rivers
- **Strategic Positioning**: Players must use actual street networks for navigation
- **Urban Combat**: Battles now happen on real street layouts and intersections
- **Authentic Geography**: Movement respects real-world city infrastructure

### Game Balance
- **25m Street Tolerance**: Positions within 25m of roads are considered valid
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: If validation fails, movement is allowed to prevent blocking
- **Smooth Transitions**: Movement speed optimized for street-based navigation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents API failures from breaking movement

## [Previous] - Deployment Fixes! üîß

### Fixed
- **Docker Build Path Issue**: Fixed deploy-simple.sh script to build Docker image from server/ directory
  - Script was looking for Dockerfile in root directory but it's located in server/ folder
  - Updated Docker build command to use correct path: `docker build -t game-server server/`
  - Resolves "failed to read dockerfile: open Dockerfile: no such file or directory" error

## [Previous] - IP-Based Geolocation Spawning! üåç

### Added
- **IP-Based Spawn Locations**: Players now spawn near their actual geographic location!
  - **Automatic IP Detection**: Server detects player's IP address and converts to coordinates
  - **Real Location Spawning**: Players spawn in their actual city/region instead of London
  - **Random Offset**: ¬±1km random offset to prevent exact same spawn points
  - **Smart Fallback**: Falls back to London if geolocation fails or for local/VPN IPs
  - **Proxy Support**: Handles x-forwarded-for headers for reverse proxy setups

### Technical Implementation
- **ip-api.com Integration**: Free geolocation service (no API key required)
- **Async Spawn System**: Non-blocking geolocation with 5-second timeout
- **Multi-IP Detection**: Supports x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, and direct IP detection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to London coordinates on any failure
- **Local IP Filtering**: Skips geolocation for localhost/private network IPs

### Enhanced Gameplay
- **Global Battle Royale**: Players worldwide can fight in their own neighborhoods
- **Location-Based Strategy**: Local knowledge of area gives tactical advantage
- **Real-World Integration**: Bridges virtual combat with actual geography
- **International Competition**: Players from different countries can meet and battle

### Enhanced Character Roster

- **Absurd Emoji Combinations**: Each South Park character has hilariously inappropriate emoji representations
- **Authentic Quotes**: Character descriptions feature iconic South Park catchphrases
- **Color Themes**: Each character maintains unique color styling on map markers
- **Random Assignment**: Players get randomly assigned from entire expanded roster

### Technical Implementation
